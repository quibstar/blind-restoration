What do I need legally for this website?

ChatGPT said:
To legally operate your blind repair website (e.g. BlindRestoration.com), you’ll want to cover several key areas to reduce liability, protect yourself, and build trust. Here's a breakdown tailored to a U.S.-based mail-in service business:

🛡️ 1. Business Structure
Set up a legal entity to separate personal assets from business liabilities.

LLC (Limited Liability Company) – most popular for small online service businesses.

Register with your state's Secretary of State (e.g., Michigan).

Get an EIN from the IRS (free) to open a business bank account.

💸 2. Payment Handling
You're likely using Stripe, PayPal, or Shopify Payments, which have their own terms — but:

Disclose pricing clearly (flat fee, shipping costs, etc.).

Have a refund policy — even if it's "no refunds after work begins."

Include terms for damaged/lost items (see below).

📄 3. Website Legal Pages (must-haves)
✅ Terms of Service
Customers agree to your process: shipping to you, paying, turnaround time.

Outline liability: You are not responsible for damage during shipping unless insured.

State handling of unrepairable or severely damaged blinds (return as-is? disposal?).

Cover service limitations (e.g. "We do not restore motorized blinds").

✅ Privacy Policy
Required by law if you collect names, emails, or addresses.

Covers what data you collect and how it’s stored (even if you're using Shopify).

✅ Shipping & Returns Policy
Who pays for inbound vs. outbound shipping?

What happens if an item is lost in transit?

State clearly: customer is responsible for safe packaging when sending to you.

📦 4. Shipping Considerations
Offer shipping instructions to minimize breakage (PDF or web page).

Consider adding insurance to outbound shipments.

Include a shipping label system (e.g. Shopify app or PirateShip integration).

📝 5. Waiver / Liability Form (Optional but Smart)
Include this in your intake process or checkout terms:

“I understand that I am shipping my blinds at my own risk. BlindRestoration.com is not liable for any damage or loss caused by the shipping carrier. Repairs will be made to the best of the technician’s ability based on the condition of the product.”

This protects you from customers blaming you for shipping issues or unrealistic expectations.

💼 6. Insurance
Optional but valuable:

General liability insurance (covers property damage claims).

Inland marine insurance (covers customer items in your possession).

Business property insurance (if operating from home, may not be covered under homeowner’s insurance).

🧾 7. Optional
Local business license (varies by city/county).

Sales tax collection: likely not required for a service business, but check your state’s rules.

Keep records for income taxes — you’ll need to report profits.

✅ Quick Legal Checklist
Item Required? Notes
LLC or sole prop ✅ LLC strongly recommended
Terms of Service ✅ Include shipping liability
Privacy Policy ✅ Required if collecting info
Refund Policy ✅ State clearly during checkout
Waiver / Consent ✅ At checkout or as a checkbox
Insurance Optional Smart for peace of mind
EIN & Bank Account ✅ Professionalism and legal separation
Business license Maybe Check local laws

If you'd like, I can:

Draft your Terms, Privacy, and Shipping Policy based on your model

Provide a boilerplate waiver

Generate a consent checkbox for Stripe or Shopify

Let me know how official or casual you want this brand to feel — we can match the tone.

You said:
Could I add the consent to the order form?

ChatGPT said:
Yes, you absolutely should add the consent to the order form — and doing so is standard best practice for service-based e-commerce, especially when dealing with customer property (like mail-in blinds).

✅ Where to Place It
If using Shopify or similar checkout platforms:
Add a required checkbox during checkout.

Label it something like:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
☑ I agree to the Terms of Service and understand that I am shipping my blinds at my own risk.
Link to your Terms of Service in the label (<a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>).

Shopify lets you add this in Settings > Checkout > Checkout customization or via an app like Order Checkbox.

✅ Consent Language Example
Here’s a strong but fair version you can use:

“By placing this order, I confirm that I am sending my blinds at my own risk. I understand that BlindRestoration.com is not responsible for any damage caused during shipping. I acknowledge that if my blinds are determined to be unrepairable, I may choose to have them returned or recycled at my discretion. I agree to the Terms of Service.”

OR simplified version:

“I understand that my blinds will be repaired based on condition and that BlindRestoration.com is not liable for any shipping damage or unrepairable items. I have read and agree to the Terms of Service.”

🛠️ Technical Integration (Shopify example)
Use a Shopify app like:

Order & Product Fees (allows custom fields)

Cart Attributes (via line item scripts)

Or add a custom cart field if you're using Shopify Liquid theme (with basic HTML and some theme tweaking).

📦 Why This Matters Legally
The checkbox acts as a digital signature.

Protects you from chargebacks and disputes.

Reinforces that you're a transparent and legitimate business.

Let me know if you want:

A Shopify-compatible consent snippet

A one-page Terms of Service and Privacy doc

A full intake + consent form for a custom Phoenix app

This one step protects your whole operation — it’s smart you asked.
