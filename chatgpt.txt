This is actually a very viable niche business idea — especially for someone with your skills and entrepreneurial background. Let’s break it down in terms of viability, probability of success, and some deeper strategic considerations:

✅ Viability
Market Demand
Yes, there’s demand: Many people have expensive blinds or shades (e.g. Hunter Douglas, Bali, Levolor) and would prefer to repair than replace, especially when it's just broken strings or tangled mechanisms.

Few local services exist, especially for restringing. If they do, they’re usually handymen or window covering stores that charge premium rates or have long wait times.

Homeowners, landlords, and property managers often seek low-cost repairs — they would love a mail-in service.

Google Trends & Forums Insight
Frequent questions on forums like Reddit, Houzz, and even Amazon Q&A sections about how to fix or restring blinds.

Many YouTube videos have comments like: “I wish someone could do this for me.”

📈 Probability of Success
Strengths
You have specialized skill and very low competition.

Lightweight shipping (most blinds aren't that heavy, just awkward in size).

High margin: restringing might take you 15–30 minutes, but you can charge $40–$100+ depending on type.

Challenges
Customer logistics: You’ll need clear instructions and processes for people to ship their blinds to you.

Trust & credibility: Since people are mailing in household items, you’ll need to look reliable (reviews, photos, maybe even a “behind the scenes” video).

Damage or liability: You’ll want a waiver or basic terms if blinds arrive broken or get damaged in return shipping.

🧠 Deep Thoughts & Strategic Considerations
Positioning
Name idea: “BlindFix.com” (if available), or “ShadeSaver”, “FixMyBlindsNow.com”, “The Blind Guy”, etc.

Emphasize eco-friendliness and cost savings over replacing.

Bonus if you specialize in “premium brand blind restringing.”

Offer Structure
Offer flat rates by blind type: “Mini blind”, “Honeycomb”, “Roman shade”, etc.

Offer bulk repair discounts (landlords, decorators, Airbnb hosts).

“Rush repair” premium tier (e.g., 2-day turnaround).

Add-ons
Replace cords with new color options, child-safe options, or motorization upgrade consultation.

Offer video call consultations for DIY restringing, for an extra fee.

💵 Potential Revenue Math
Metric	Conservative Estimate
Avg price per repair	$60
Repairs per week (low scale)	15
Weekly gross	$900
Monthly gross	$3,600
Scale-up potential	$10K+/mo

Higher-end: Add an employee, expand into mobile pickup locally, or add tutorials/products for DIYers.

🚀 Launch Plan
Landing page with FAQ, pricing, how it works, testimonials (use past clients or friends).

Set up shipping instructions page — keep it dead simple.

Accept payments via Stripe or PayPal.

Launch Google Ads for:

“fix broken blinds”

“blind restringing service”

“mail-in blind repair”

Set up a Shopify site or use Carrd + Stripe to start lean.

Bonus: Start a YouTube or TikTok channel showing restringing — builds trust and SEO.

💡 Verdict
This is:

Original enough to avoid saturation.

Simple to execute for someone like you.

High-margin and low overhead.

Resilient: Especially in times when people want to save money.

You could have this running in a weekend.
